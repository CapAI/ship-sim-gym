## Installation

Make sure you are not using Python 3.7. It's not supported by ray / rllib and a few others at moment of writing.

[stable-baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) has specific prerequisites listed in the README.

You can try to do a pip install -r requirements.txt

If you get any errors, find all of the repos online, clone them and do local pip install .

Also see the requirements at each repo, especially stable-baselines has few local ones.

PyGame instructions should be found separately onine
